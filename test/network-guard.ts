/**
 * Network guard for the test suite (preloaded via bunfig.toml).
 *
 * Every test must inject its own `fetch` (`fetchImpl` / `options.fetch`) or
 * spawn a local fixture. A test — or a helper that silently falls back to the
 * global fetch — must never reach a live endpoint, and never with a
 * developer's `VERBOO_API_KEY` (which would spend real quota against
 * https://code.verboo.ai).
 *
 * Replacing `globalThis.fetch` with a loud throw makes an accidental live call
 * fail immediately instead of burning tokens. It exists to keep the suite
 * fully mocked.
